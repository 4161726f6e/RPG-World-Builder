Roll,Red Herring,Description
1#10,Artifact That Doesn't Work,Often epic quests against powerful Master Villains require that the heroes find some legendary artifact - the only object which can defeat the villain. If your heroes have had no trouble getting to that artifact - they've effortlessly sliced through every obstacle you've put in their path and are confidently advancing on the resting place of the magical item - you can have it not work. This is obvious as soon as the heroes lay hands upon it. It may be broken; magical analysis may indicate that all magic has been drained out of it; it may be lacking some essential parts or elements. And because of this the heroes are not as far along as they thought. They'll either have to find another mighty item to fulfill their mission or will have to embark on another quest to find the essential elements to repair the artifact they have found. Caution: this is a cruel and unnecessary thing to do if the characters have really been working hard to attain their ends; it should only be done when the adventure has so far inexplicably been a cakewalk for them.
11#20,Extraneous Details,"When giving the heroes details on their enemy - for instance details they are learning from investigations and readings - you can give them just a few details too many. This may prompt the heroes to investigate the ""extra"" (or irrelevant) details in addition to the relevant ones thus losing them valuable time. Such irrelevant details might include: the place of the Master Villain's birth (it turns out not to have any bearing at all on his current activities); the writings of the Master Villain or one of his Minor Villain minions (it turns out to be fascinating reading in the villain's area of expertise but has absolutely no bearing on the villain's current activities)."
21#50,False Path to the Artifact,"If the heroes have had too easy a time finding the artifact capable of destroying the villain then give them trouble this way: When they get to the place where the artifact is supposed to be contained they find the coffer or chamber empty - obviously looted by robbers who have scrawled such remarks as ""Kelrog Was Here!"" upon the walls. The artifact could indeed have been stolen by this Kelrog person - meaning the heroes will have to continue their quest to find it. Alternatively this could be a clever ploy by the persons who originally hid the artifact. it might be in a chamber beneath the supposedly looted (but actually never occupied) treasure chamber; the builders made it appear empty so that the first robbers on the scene would find it already looted. The heroes might not realize this scam until their investigations reveal that this Kelrog person lived centuries before the chamber was built or filled."
51#60,Loony Who Has It Wrong,"You can have the heroes ""aided"" by a so-called expert who is actually a lunatic who doesn't know anything about what he's talking about. Once he's led the heroes off to some remote part of the continent his evasive answers and bizarre behavior will alert them that he really doesn't know anything about what he's pretended to be an expert on."
61#100,Lying Rumor,"This is the worst and most useful type of red herring - the interesting rumor which just happens to be false. In adventures of this sort the best Lying Rumor concerns the Master Villain; it gives the heroes some ""important"" information about him which later turns out to be useless. Such rumors include: (1) Goal Incorrect. The rumor states that the Master Villain's goal is one thing when in fact it's another. (2) Potential Ally No Linger Lives. The heroes hear about a potential ally who could be a big help. When they get to him they find only his grave. (3) Species Incorrect. A clever Master Villain might leak false rumors about what sort of thing he is. A Pit Fiend might call himself the Vampire King so that when the heroes break in with their sharpened stakes and holy water they are in for some confusion and disappointment."
