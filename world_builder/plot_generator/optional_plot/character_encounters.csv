Roll,Character,Description,Level and Abilities
1#5,Bandit Gang,When the heroes are en route from one place to another they come across one of the local bandit gangs. The bandits are faster and far more numerous than the heroes. Make it clear to the heroes that if they really have a fight to the finish with these bandits then all the heroes will surely die. But the bandits stay back. They swarm around the heroes and demonstrate their daring but not attacking. Basically they're bandits who admire courage and prowess and the bandit leader will challenge one or all of the heroes to some test of bravery or ability - such as a horserace or a duel or a wrestling match or a joust or an arm-wrestling match where scorpions sting the loser or etc. If the heroes lose then they lose their horses or ship; if the heroes win then they win the bandit leader's horse (or treasure of some sort) and are free to go after they feast and celebrate with the bandits.,The bandit who participates in the duel or trial should be a Fighter at his opponent's experience level.
6#15,Belligerent Soldier,The belligerent one has just had his ears pinned back by his commanding officer and is anxious to take it out on some hapless civilian. If this is a city gate then he claims that the hero's papers are wrong or that he recognizes the hero from descriptions of a wanted criminal; if this is the streets then he insults the hero's lack of military bearing or pretty looks or clothes or smell or companion or whatever it takes to provoke a reaction. Obviously the belligerent one wants to fight and pound the hero to mash and throw him into the jail for a day or two. If he defeats the hero then that's precisely what happens. If the hero beats him (should usually be the case) then you can have one of several things happen. If the hero kills him or merely defeats him and then runs away without defending his actions to the authorities then the city guard or army will be out to capture the hero; even if the killing was justified then the hero has to stand trial to confirm this. If the hero doesn't kill him and stays to deal with the authorities then you may either have an intelligent and sympathetic officer to agree with the hero (leading to the belligerent one's losing rank and face - see New Enemy) or have a hard-edge officer agree with his subordinate which leads to the heroes being unfairly pursued by the law.,Soldier might be a Fighter at just under the hero's level or might be a few levels higher.
16#20,Blackmailer,If the party is pulling a scam then this person knows it and can tell the potential victim; if they're wanted by the authorities then he's willing to alert the authorities that they're here; if they're hiding out from the Master Villain then he's going to tell said villain that they're here; he may have kidnapped one of their favorite NPCs and be holding them for ransom; and so on. But first he sends a message to the heroes that he's willing not to undertake this action if he's given a substantial financial contribution. The heroes may wish just to pay the hush money - in which case the blackmailer complains it's not enough and blackmails them some more. The heroes may wish to give him the money and try to track him back to his lair which can lead to a confrontation with this blackguard and his gang or even the local Thieve's Guild.,Any class but probably Thief or Assassin at half the average party level.
21#25,Bureaucrat,"Some time in their adventure the heroes must deal with the local government and run into that most horrible of nuisance monsters - the bureaucrat and his red-tape dispenser. The heroes don't have the right forms. When they have the right forms they forgot to fill them out in triplicate. When they've gotten them filled out then they have to make an appointment. They wait for their appointment only to find it has been cancelled. They fill out new forms and make their second appointment and the horrified bureaucrat informs them that they forgot to bring the ""present"" (bribe) duly required of visitors to His Exaltedness. And so on. Of course if they players are savvy enough to bribe this fellow from the start then they'll have no trouble at all.",Normal Man/Woman with no special abilities (except skill with Bureaucracy) to speak of.
26#35,Inquisitive Official,Some local authority has noticed the characters' presence and it makes her curious. She snoops around asking questions all the time. She may be a city guardsman or special agent of the ruler but (functionally) she's a police lieutenant who asks the wrong questions at the wrong time; the heroes have to work around her by sneaking where normally they'd be able to work in the open.,Can be a Normal Man/Woman with no special abilities to speak of or can be up to the heroes' average party level and of any class.
36#40,Lying Accuser,A captured thief may accuse the character of putting him up to the theft; an abandoned mother may accuse the hero of fathering her child; a reputable witness (working for the master villain) may accuse the hero of a murder or robbery. The hero shouldn't know what he's being accused of until he's hauled in by the authorities. The heroes may lose time proving their innocence or may have to break the accused out of jail which puts the authorities on their trail through the rest of the adventure.,Normal Man/Woman with no special abilities.
41#50,Old Friend at the Wrong Time,When the heroes are trying to sneak through a guard post or citadel or city where they can't afford to be recognized then one of the character's old friends recognizes him and loudly renews their acquaintance in full view of the guards looking for the characters. This usually leads to an exciting chase as the heroes must escape.,Any.
51#60,Mean Drunk,The Mean Drunk works much like the Belligerent Soldier except that he's not as tough and is of course drunk which means he's also usually accompanied by other Mean Drunks.,Fighter at half to one-third the heroes' average experience level.
61#70,New Enemy,In the course of his ordinary activities one of the heroes can make a New Enemy. Hurrying along the street he can bump into a disagreeable fighter for whom an apology isn't enough; in a tavern he can make some innocuous remark that you deliberately have the irritable fellow misconstrue as an insult. The New Enemy will only exchange heated words with the hero at this point but will appear again later in the adventure - he could be a minion of the Master Villain or just coincidentally traveling along the heroes' path - and will eventually have to fight the hero.,Same class and level as the hero in question.
71#75,Press Gang,This encounter works best with low-level heroes. In any port city the heroes - in a tavern or hostel - may find themselves set upon by ruffians employed by the city; these ruffians use clubs and strike to subdue. If the heroes fight and beat the ruffians then they find themselves wanted by the law for assaulting officers of the peace. If they fight and lose then they wake up to find themselves sailors headed far away from their quest! Now they must decide whether they're going to jump ship or mutiny or just settle down to a few years of seafaring life.,Fighters from first to third level.
76#85,Seducer,"One of the characters is invited to a romantic liaison with an attractive local. This local can be any one of several things: (1) They could just be interested in a brief tryst; (2) They could fall madly in love with the hero and follow the hero through the rest of the adventure; (3) They could be a ""Loving Deceiver"" from the Monster Encounters; (4) They could be a thief and rob the hero blind in the course of their liaison; (5) They could be a spy or assassin working for the Master Villain.",Varies with choices given above; usually Normal Man/Woman with no special abilities.
86#95,Thief,At some point in their adventure the heroes have a run-in with thieves. Some sample encounters: (1) Walking along the streets one hero is bumped into by a local who then apologizes. After a few more steps the hero realizes his money-pouch has been lifted and the thief who bumped into him takes off. This leads to a mad chase through the city streets through the marketplace and across rooftops and through alleys - and perhaps ambushers waiting there. Depending on how daring and aggressive they are the heroes may or may not recover the money. (2) Returning to their inn from a hard day's adventuring/investigating the heroes walk in on a thief burglarizing their room. This thief high-tails it out the window which leads to a grand chase. (3) The heroes return to their inn to find their rooms sacked and burglarized. The occupant of the next room got a good look at one of them which was good enough for the heroes to be able to track him down; they must find him and catch him and force a confession from him and find out where his allies are fencing the goods if they plan to get their property back.,Low (first to third) level thieves.
96#100,Truthful Accuser,This encounter is like the Lying Accuser except the accuser is telling the truth. Dig through your characters' pasts and uncover a misdeed or two and when the heroes are at a critical point in their adventure confront them with someone they actually have wronged. This person has found them and appealed to the sympathetic local authorities. The heroes will have to make good or have the authorities on their backs for some time to come.,Normal Man/Woman with no special abilities.
