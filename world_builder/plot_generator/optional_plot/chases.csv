Roll,Chase,Description
1#10,Aerial,The heroes could be riding pegasi or friendly griffons or allied great eagles; the villains could be carried aloft by gargoyles or demons. The prospect of taking a mile-long fall if one's mount is hit is a very daunting and challenging one for the hero. You could have the adventure involve the creation of some sort of magical airship: the heroes could be loaned an airship by wizards or the villain could have created one. In the latter case the Master Villain escapes in his ship and the heroes must give pursuit on the backs of flying animals - or perhaps using an earlier and smaller and cruder model of the ship.
11#20,Endurance,This is not some sort of climatic chase - it's a rugged and tiring and persistent pursuit that tests the characters to their limits. In this chase the heroes and villains are pursuing one another across a lot of territory and they're not catching up with one another very fast. This may be a horseback pursuit across a hundred miles of savannah or a camel chase across several days' worth of desert or a chase across arctic tundra. in any case the chase is so rigorous that the heroes need to roll a save vs poison every day (with CON modifiers to the roll) or lose 1-4 HP from exhaustion. The same may apply to their mounts if the heroes are pushing them too hard.
21#40,Footrace,The chase involves the characters on foot - probably through such terrain as city streets or the corridors of a palace. One hero may realize that he's being pursued by a party of enemies and choose to run for it; the heroes may have caught up to the Master Villain which prompts him to run for his life. if you want to spice up your footrace then lead it into some of the interesting places described in the Special Terrain chase.
41#60,Horseback,This is a relatively short chase - it only needs to go on for a mile or so before even the best horses are winded. If it goes on longer than that then the horses may collapse and perhaps die. Use whatever means you prefer to determine whether the pursuers catch up to the pursued. If the heroes are being chased then they may be able to use their own cleverness or knowledge of the area to elude capture. If the heroes are doing the pursuing then the same may apply: they might know a shortcut to head off the villains; alternatively they may be better riders or have fresher horses. Don't forget that when one party on horses catches up to another the result may be a joust - another classic confrontation.
61#90,Special Terrain,You can make any chase more memorable by having it take place in a setting to which it is utterly unsuited. For instance horse chases are fine and dramatic when they take place through the forest or out on the plains or along a road - but they become diabolical when they take place inside the Royal Palace or in a dangerous labyrinth or treacherous catacombs. Some examples: (1) Catacombs. Have the heroes contend with poor lighting (characters without infravision must carry their own torches) and collapsing flooring (which injures them and deposits them in lower levels of the catacombs) and close encounters with catacomb dwellers. (2) Inside a building. Interesting to a footrace and very interesting with horse races; the heroes must contend with narrow hallways and furniture and the inhabitants and slick floors (too slick for horses) and low-hanging chandeliers and other problems. (3) Rooftops. Footraces become very dangerous when one participant takes to the roofs; participants have to deal with jumps across alleyways and collapsing roofs and breaking slate rooftop tiles and sliding down a slanted roof and catching one's self on the gutters or other projections and so on. (4) Swamp. The classic choice for footraces and horse chases provides you with fetid pools filled with monsters and quicksand and will-o-the-wisp encounters and consistently bad footing. (5) Through the city. With the simple chase from one end of the city to the other (foot or horse) you get to put the racers through different types of neighborhoods (palatial estates and markets and slums) and the interesting color and inhabitants they provide.
91#100,Water,Whether it's a battle of seamanship between naval vessels or a chase of rafts toward the inevitable waterfall ahead or a contest of canoeing ability or a chase between the villain and his giant shark vs the heroes and their dolphin friends the water chase can be a distinctive and dramatic one.
