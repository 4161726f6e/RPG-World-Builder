Roll,Moral Quandary,Description
1#15,The Ally,"You set up the situation so that the heroes have a good chance at defeating the Master Villain if they get the aid of two specific individuals - probably experts in their fields relating to the villains' activities. But the two experts hate one another and refuse to work together even if it costs them their world. Don't let the heroes know that there is a problem until the two experts are brought together and realize that the heroes want them both. Then let the sparks fly with a NPC vs NPC confrontation - which includes name-calling directed at the heroes who ""should have known better than to drag this flea-bitten pretender/this dastard with brains like gruel"" ... etc. The heroes are now in the position of having to choose between the two NPCs who are equally vital. If you like you can give them a chance to persuade the NPCs to work together - but they have to put together one amazing argument to be successful. If they are not then the original dilemma is still with them."
16#30,The Friend,"At a critical point in the story one of the campaign's NPCs makes an impossible demand of one of the heroes. What sort of demand? Here's one favorite - the Lover's Complaint: ""I can't stand you risking your life all the timeâ€¦ don't go - stay with me - I need you... if you leave this time I won't be here when you get back."" Another one - uttered by very under-powered NPCs just as the heroes are about to undertake the most dangerous part of the story - is something we can call the Nebbish's Lament: ""All my life I haven't been good enough... I've never succeeded at anything I've done... You've got to take me with you... I know it's dangerous but this is my last chance to prove myself..."""
31#60,The Honor,You want to use this on the character with the most strongly developed sense of personal honor - someone who has lived all their life by a strict code. Toward the end of the adventure this character realizes that the best way to defeat the Master Villain is a violation of that code. For instance - the character might be a paladin who discovers that the only possible way for the heroes to defeat the Master Villain is to sneak up on him and stab him in the back. A variation on this is when the character's god suddenly becomes pragmatic and orders the character to perform actions which are outside the code of honor practiced by the character. When the stakes are big enough - as they are when dealing with the plans of very powerful Master Villains - gods may become fretful and order their favorite heroes to actions which the heroes oppose. Here the hero faces not only the loss of honor but perhaps also punishment from their god. Caution: It is possible to ruin a character by utilizing this quandary. If at the adventure's end the player feels that their character has been permanently dishonored they may not wish to play the character any more. You can prevent this by making the honorable choice the better choice or by providing means within the hero's culture or order for the hero to do penance for their dishonor.
61#80,The Respect,The heroes have been utilizing the aid of two (or more) powerful NPC allies. As an example one is an old military man and the other is a wizard. In the course of the adventure the heroes come across a task which can be accomplished in one of two ways - through military intervention or by esoteric magic (for example). The heroes have to choose between these options - each of which seems equally viable. The problem is that the NPC allies are agitating for different choices and the one whom the heroes choose against will no longer aid them.
81#100,The Saving,Another classic quandary puts the heroes in the position of choosing between a grand opportunity to hurt the Master Villain - or saving the lives of a number of individuals. For instance while the heroes are sleeping in a small village while on the road in campaigns against the Master Villain they wake up one morning to hear two interesting things. A distant farmer has discovered that one of the most important Minor Villains and his men are encamped in a distant glade. If the heroes go there and then attack and defeat him then they will score an important coup against the Master Villain. Trouble is that the farmer heard the Minor Villain discussing tomorrow's attack on this village; another party of minions - led by a less-important Minor Villain - will be destroying this village today. The heroes can either travel to the site of the Minor Villain and strike a blow against the Master Villain or stay here and weather the attack of the invaders. Caution: This is only good when the heroes actually care about the innocents in their charge. If they're neutral then this is no quandry at all; they'll attack.
