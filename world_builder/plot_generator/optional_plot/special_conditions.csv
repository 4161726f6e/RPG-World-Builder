Roll,Condition,Description
1#15,Coping With a Curse,The curse might be making the hero progressively uglier or might be draining out his life-force (he's losing experience which will be returned if he succeeds) or might be making him progressively insane. Each day as he sees his reflection in a mirror or pond or fountain he'll know himself to be less than he used to be.
16#25,Magic Doesn't Work Right,If the adventure is taking place on an alternate plane then that plane's magic works oddly or not at all. A spell-caster will find that just making himself useful is a challenge when none of his spells work. If the adventure takes place on your usual campaign world then pick a site where this anomalous magical effect is taking place. It could be the temple of some unusual god or the site of an artifact or the site of some ancient magical war. You can make some spells not work at all while others are weakened and still others are stronger. Characters with no magic might now have spells or may be utterly magic-resistant (don't forget the villain). Characters might have to make a saving throw vs Magic just to cast spells successfully.
26#35,No Hurting the Villain,For some reason the heroes cannot afford to fight the villain directly. For instance - what if a demon possesses the body of a child of one of the characters or a very important child spoken of in prophecy or one without whom the world will perish?
36#45,No Lawbreaking,For some reason at one point in the story the heroes cannot allow themselves to break the law - even when it would help them greatly to do so. For instance - the heroes may be asking for the help of a king whose word is law and whose power is immense. Then they arrive for their audience an emissary of the Master Villain is making a similar plea for help. If the heroes attack and kill the emissary then they will lose any chance at the king's help - in fact he may order their execution. Worse - the king decides to consider their requests and commands them to return in three days. In the meantime they are not to harm one another. The heroes soon find that they're being scrupulously watched and the enemy emissary is continually taunting them and bragging that his request will be granted and theirs will not. He may even fabricate evidence to convince the heroes of this. the heroes' lives will be hell until the king decides - and will certainly be hell if they decide to kill the enemy emissary.
46#55,No Weapons Allowed,At some point in the story the heroes must surrender their weapons. Perhaps they're visiting some quarter of the city where weapons are not allowed; or a particularly peace-loving temple. In any case - once they're there they are attacked by enemies belonging to the Master Villain. If they have holdout weapons but don't use them then they may perish at the hands of their enemies while if they do use them then they earn the enmity of the local ruler or temple official. It's a delicate situation.
56#60,Omnipresent Observer,If a wizard or demigod or god has forced the heroes to undertake this quest then he may be with them continually - in spirit. He can't help them but does magically watch everything they do. And when they do something he doesn't like he will tell them about it - loudly and nastily. (This is distressing when they're trying to break into a fortress or sneak through enemy lines.) This observer will be opposed to one or more of the heroes' normal procedures (such as ambushing enemies; that's dishonorable) and won't let them get away with it even though it might be efficient and make it more likely for them to succeed in their quest.
61#65,Stolen Identities,This option requires that the Master Villain be of godlike power or possess some sort of artifact. Once the Master Villain realizes that the heroes are on his tail he uses his powers or artifact and steals the heroes' identities. One day they wake up - and no one else knows who they are. They retain their memories of themselves and each other but no one else does. (The villain knows them though.) They can't return to their estates; their families deny they are who they say they are and say the heroes are adventuring abroad. Thus they must complete the adventure without allies or resources beyond what they can beg or borrow or steal from an uncaring world.
66#100,Time-Limit,The most obvious condition to place on an adventure is to give it a time limit. If the Master Villain is going to conclude his evil spell in only three days and his citadel is three hard days' riding away then the heroes are going to be on the go all throughout the adventure - with little time to rest or plan or gather allies or anything except get to where they're going.
