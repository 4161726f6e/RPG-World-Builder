Roll,Omen or Prophecy,Description
1#10,Birthmark Pertains,One of the heroes has a birthmark that pertains to the adventure in some way. He may have a birthmark identical to some NPC - for instance some person endangered by the Master Villain. This mystery can give the hero his reason to become involved. (Why do the characters have identical birthmarks? Either they're related - which a careful search of their backgrounds might reveal - or they've been so afflicted by some god in order that the hero help this other person - which consultation with a high-level cleric can reveal.) Alternatively his birthmark may mark him as a hero fulfilling some ancient prophecy.
11#20,Comet's Progress,Events during the adventure may be enlivened by a large and menacing comet which appears in the night sky for several days during the scenario; the locals take it for an omen of doom. The comet may be the result of magic being used by the Master Villain in which case research by high-level wizards will reveal this; or the comet's appearance can pertain to an old legend involving the Master Villain.
21#30,Fortune-Teller Predicts Doom,This is an ominous encounter: A fortune-teller predicts doom for one of the heroes or for some community menaced by the Master Villain. If the heroes aren't in the habit of consulting fortune-tellers then this mystic could stumble out of any crowd and pinpoint the hero he wishes to warn and issue his dire prophecies and then disappear back into the crowd. if caught or questioned then he can't describe how he knows that doom is in the offing - the cards told him or his (non-magical) crystal ball told him... he just knows. Shortly after this some calamity should befall the hero: he can be attacked by an assassin or be in a building when it is struck by fire or an earthquake or suffer other danger. Investigation of the events can then point the heroes toward the Master Villain as the event's instigator. The Villain may not have been deliberately targeting the hero; the hero's involvement in the story may be purely accidental as far as the Master Villain is concerned.
31#60,Hero Fulfills Prophecy,This is the most useful sort of prophecy. In the early part of the adventure one of the heroes discovers that he fulfills some ancient prophecy. He might have stood on some famous landmark on the particular day of the year that a sunbeam shining through a nearby hole in the rock illuminated him for all to see. He may have arrived with his clothes and equipment arrayed in some fashion that had been long ago predicted by a seer; tie this in with the way the hero customarily dresses or have an accident befall him so that he arrives in this condition (with one boot missing or his top half splattered with mud while his bottom half is clean or etc.). You have to decide what the prophecy is. It may be that the hero is the only one who can defeat the Master Villain. It may be that that the hero is supposed to kill the king (this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy when the king attacks or jails the heroes). It may be that the hero is the only one who can correct some old problem - such as by awakening a long-sleeping princess with a kiss - but that his action rouses the ire of the Master Villain.
61#80,Innocent Fulfills Prophecy,An innocent could fulfill a prophecy - one which endangers their life. This innocent might be the one who is supposed to slay the king but is not a mighty adventurer able to protect himself from the king; the heroes my find themselves sheltering and helping this poor dupe.
81#90,Reincarnation,After seeing the portrait of some long-dead nobleman the hero may be surprised to see his own face staring back at him. All evidence points to the fact that our hero is the reincarnation of this person and the Master Villain may desire to destroy any trace of that nobleman's existence. Just as appropriately this long-dead nobleman may have died after making some important choice - such as choosing love over career or career over friends; and the choice he faced is identical to one the hero now faces. Will our her defy the prophecy and choose as he did in a previous life or will he choose the other option and see what happens?
91#100,Totem Animal,If a hero has an animal which is his totem then he may see the animal engaged in a fight to the death with another animal - one which is coincidentally the totem of one of the villains. How his totem defeats the other - or is defeated by it - gives the hero some clues as how to fight his actual opponent when the time comes.
