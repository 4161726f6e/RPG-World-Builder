Roll,Cruel Trick,Description
1#10,Heroes Must Work With Villain,If they have to work for the villain then it's due to some hold he has over them - probably he's kidnapped one of their NPCs and will kill this person if his demands aren't met. Put the heroes through an encounter where they have to do something they're loathe to do such as sack and pillage a temple before they have the opportunity to retrieve their friend. Alternatively the heroes may have to work with the villain because an even worse villain has turned up! If you choose this option then roll on the Master Villain chart twice (and roll two Minor Villains for each Master). The less nasty Master Villain (i.e. the lesser of two evils) is the one who concocts the first Master Plot and first encounters the heroes. But halfway through the story the second and nastier Master Villain unveils his Master Plot and the heroes and first villain must collaborate if they're to survive.
11#30,Mission Is a Ruse,In the course of their adventuring the heroes discover they have been tricked into performing a mission which helps the Master Villain. For instance: the Master Villain might release rumors that a certain artifact is the only thing that can slay him. In truth it's his favorite weapon - but only someone of pure heart can retrieve it from the lawful-good chamber where it is held. When the heroes recover it the Master Villain swoops in and takes it and thanks them; the heroes are now worse off than ever.
31#50,NPC Turns Traitor,He may alert the enemy when the heroes are planning a raid; he may steal the artifact and take it to the villain; he may stab a hero or important NPC in the back (literally) before departing. Why does he do this? Some choices: (1) This may not really be the NPC; he could have been replaced by a doppelg√§nger or shapeshifter. (2) The NPC might be under some powerful compulsion - blackmail or a variant type of charm spell or a limited wish - which temporarily makes him the villain's minion. In any case this inevitably leads to a final confrontation within the villain's citadel where the heroes find out if the NPC really did betray them - and if so then fight him to the death. Caution: It is easy to overuse this trick. You'll find that having the NPC betray the heroes' trust is a bit less dramatic when the party never trusted him in the first place.
51#60,Villain Accompanies Party,In this distressing situation the Master Villain - in disguise or his secret identity - accompanies the heroes for much of their quest. He gets to know them and learns their strengths and weaknesses and just as soon as it's most efficient for him he thwarts their current plans and leaves. Alternatively the Master Villain might be with the heroes all along and up to the very end; the heroes know that one of their companions is the villain and the whole thrust of the story is finding out who he is. This is the whole purpose of most Mystery-type adventures.
61#70,Villain Is Related to Hero,"In this very irritating complication one of the heroes discovers that the Master Villain is related to him. The villain might be his long-lost father or twin; perhaps this relative is not long-lost after all but has secretly been a master Villain for years and only now has the hero discovered it. This may or may not change the heroes' plans and approach. it could be that the heroes will now try to ""save"" or reform the Master Villain; perhaps they won't. It doesn't really matter; this Cruel Trick is really not used to force the heroes to figure out a whole new approach to defeating the Master Villain. No - in actuality it's just another way of bending the hero's mind and making him suffer as he has to confront and work against a relative he'd prefer not to have to oppose."
71#100,Wanted By the Law,When the heroes are wanted by the law they have to travel in secret and are very limited in the resources they can acquire. This becomes a very attractive Cruel Trick to play when the heroes have to have the help of the authorities to beat the villain. This means they'll have to prove their innocence to the law before continuing - perhaps having to sit around and stand trial while the Master Villain is continuing with his plan.
