Roll,Secret Weakness,Description,How this manifests itself
1#20,Element or Ingredient,The Master Villain can be banished/dispelled/killed or otherwise defeated by some sort of element or ingredient: (1) A metal (gold/silver/iron); (2) A type of gemstone; (3) A specific plant (mistletoe/wolfsbane/red rose); (4) A common ingredient or element (sunlight/water/soil/leather).,"The Master Villain tries to get rid of all the examples of this element in his vicinity; he doesn't let his minions carry it or bring it into his presence. But he's not stupid; he doesn't announce to the world what his weakness is. He tries to hide his concern within another command. If he's allergic to red roses then he might order all ""things of beauty"" destroyed within miles of his abode. The heroes may find out what his specific weakness is from research (research which would not yield anything if they didn't know about the peculiar behavior which conceals his weakness) or from bribing or interrogating minor Villains close to the throne."
21#40,Holy Symbol,The villain may have the traditional weakness to a specific holy symbol - but don't choose just an ordinary one. It may be a holy symbol no longer used by the church or may be some forgotten variation on the current symbol. (For instance the cross may not work but a variation such as the Roman cross might; alternatively it might have to be a holy symbol which has undergone some unfamiliar ritual.),the villain will be destroying the temples in which this holy symbol appears but the heroes will not know precisely why unless they interview survivors of these raids and learn that the minions were very interested in destroying those particular symbols. Even so you should give the heroes an early encounter with the Master Villain so that when they flash the untreated or slightly-wrong symbol at him he can merely laugh at them. Then they have to figure out why he's worried about this symbol when it doesn't hurt him.
41#60,Lack of Familiarity,If the Master Villain comes from the past or another dimension or belongs to an alien race then he might be sufficiently unfamiliar with this world that he essentially defeats himself. How? By making incorrect guesses about human behavior. One classic error involves underestimating the human capacity for self-sacrifice. For instance when the heroes burst in on the villain's throne room they find him with an artifact which will enable him to complete his plans - but can be disarmed if they all throw themselves into its deadly interior. When the villain realizes that they're willing to do so he's already defeated; he'll probably leave this plane in frustration before the heroes do kill themselves.,All his minions will have noticed the villain's odd interpretations; all the heroes have to do is capture (or convert) a Minor Villain and they'll learn useful facts about the state of the Master Villain's mind.
61#80,Love,"The Master Villain possesses the ""weakness"" of genuine affection or love - probably for some NPC though it could be very intriguing if the object of their affection is a player character. The heroes can then defeat the villain by holding their loved one hostage or proving that the loved one will be seriously harmed/betrayed/killed if the villain keeps up with their activity.",If the loved one is one of his minions then the Master Villain may devote too many of his resources to rescue this person from capture or death - alerting the heroes to the fact that this relationship is different from what it seems to be. The villain may be keeping his loved one in great security in his citadel; an interrogated or talkative Minor Villain could talk about the area of the citadel no one but the Master may visit. When the heroes infiltrate the citadel they're sure to go there and meet the NPC in question and discover the villain's secret.
81#100,Secret Embarrassment,The villain may have some aberration or secret shame that will force him to flee when he is confronted with it. It could be something as simple as the fact that his nose is too big or that he is a small and nebbishy wizard pretending to be some vast and powerful demonic power. When his shame is revealed he is too humiliated to continue; this is a good option for comedy adventures.,Inevitably this embarrassment is revealed when the heroes accidentally or purposefully see the true form of the Master Villain and realize that he is not like the paintings/images/descriptions given of him - in fact he's a lot less imposing.
