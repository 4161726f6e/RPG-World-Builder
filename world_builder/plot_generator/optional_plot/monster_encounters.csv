Roll,Monster,Description,Recommendation
1#10,Assassin-Beast,At some point in the adventure this beast is sent by the master villain to attack one or more heroes when they're at their most vulnerable  - asleep or enjoying themselves or otherwise. Usually the assassin-beast attacks but the hero (though injured) is able to hold it off long enough for his friends to respond to his shouts. The assassin-beast is usually killed by his friends who can then speculate on who sent it and why. Obviously the assassin-beast is not a good choice if the master villain is unlikely to employ it: the God of Chance and the Lovable Rogue (for instance).,Aerial Servant or Demons Type I-VI or Lesser and Greater Devils or Djinn or Efreet or Gargoyle or Golems or Harpy or Invisible Stalker or Rakshasa.
11#15,Beast Amok,Some time when the heroes are in a village or city an animal (probably an otherwise tame or captured beast) is set loose by the villain's minions or driven mad by the master villain. The beast goes berserk in the crowds; if the heroes aren't inclined to capture or kill it then it goes after them. In ocean-going vessels this beast could be caged trade goods en route to a foreign port.,Apr or Baboon or Bear or Giant Beetle or Boar or Bull or Dragon (baby) or Flightless Bird or Giant Porcupine.
16#25,Foreshadowing Monster,With this monster encounter combat may not be necessary. This monster encounter exists to alert the characters to the fact that something unusual is going on - a foreshadowing of their upcoming conflicts with the master villain.,Have the heroes stumble across an assassin-beast just as he's finished murdering some NPC who also opposed the master villain (perhaps someone they intended to enlist to their cause). Or have the heroes encounter a terrain monster which is not where it should be or not behaving as it should - a bear driven out of the woods by the master villain's monsters there now for instance.
26#30,King Beast,At some point in their adventure the heroes run across a king beast - some enormous and intelligent monster (which speaks the common tongue) which is the leader of its species. Perhaps it needs help; if the heroes help it they'll earn themselves a favor which the king beast will repay at some later time in the adventure. Perhaps the heroes are in deadly danger and need help; the king beast can be persuaded to help but only in return for a deed or favor in the future.,Centaur or Djinn or Dragon or Giant Eagle or Elephant or Griffon or Hippogriff or Ki-Rin or Lion or Minotaur or Giant Owl or Pegasus or Giant Ram or Treant or Unicorn or Whale.
31#40,Loving Deceiver,One of the PCs attracts the attentions of a very attractive local. This local person (encountered in unthreatening surroundings) invites the hero off to a liaison away from friends and other people. This person is a human-appearing monster of some sort; once alone with the character they will attack the PC with monstrous intent. The hero may be able to fight off the monster; otherwise you may wish to give their companions clues (such as comments by local residents who didn't recognize the monster who claimed to be a local) that their friend is in danger.,Succubus or Type V Demon or Doppelg√§nger or Jackal-were or certain very powerful Lamias who can shape-change or Vampire.
41#45,Noble Beast,With this encounter the heroes find that they have to capture - but not injure - some sort of powerful noble beast in order to accomplish their mission. For instance to reach a mountain-top aerie they must capture pegasi and ride them up to their enemy. You'll have to decide why the heroes must capture this sort of creature (i.e. what it is the monster can do for the characters that they can't do for themselves) and choose a monster appropriate to that task. Then the heroes must figure out how they are going to capture the beasts without harming them. Note that gods often enter the picture in these incidents - sometimes against the heroes. Legend has it that these beasts are protected by a local god so if the heroes hurt or kill the beast then they incur the wrath of the god in question.,Dolphin (to get to undersea places fast) or Dragon (to get to aerial sites or into areas only dragons may enter) or Giant Eagle or Griffon or Leprechaun (to get information about the lands of Faerie) or Pegasus or Sphinx (for its wisdom) or Unicorn (to fulfill some magical spell).
46#60,Nocturnal Predator,This is a classic monster encounter: the arrival of a hungry carnivore in the middle of the night. Usually this attack happens to heroes camping between villages or out in the deep wilderness: a wild animal attracted by food odors sneaks in for a bite.,Anhkheg or Giant Ant or Carnivorous Ape or Bear or Giant Beetle or Black Pudding or Bugbear or Chimera or Dinosaur or Gargoyle or Jackalwere or Lycanthrope or Peryton or Giant Snake or Giant Spider or Wolf or Wyvern or Yeti.
61#65,Powerful Tester,This is an unusual but potentially very dangerous monster encounter. Here some powerful and intelligent monster with shapeshifting ability turns into a human form. When the heroes encounter it they appear to be in need of help or having trouble. They may be having difficulty crossing a stream or carrying their load in to the village; they may be starving and in need of food; they may be harassed by bullies; they may claim that their infant daughter has been taken away by slavers. In any case they need help and can't reward the heroes for their help and will only serve to slow the heroes down from their quest. If the heroes help them anyway then the Powerful Tester can do one of two things. They can reveal themselves in their true form and announce that they are pleased with the heroes and offer them aid some time in the future; all they have to do is shout its name or speak some chant and it will appear; then it leaves. Or it can still pretend to be the beleaguered human and thank them mightily and then shuffle out of sight; much later when the heroes are in their gravest need it will then show up in its true form to help them.,Couatl or Gold Dragon or Silver Dragon or Ki-Rin or Nymph or Pixie or Shedu or Sylph or Titan.
66#88,Ravager,This is another classic monster encounter: the monster which is bedeviling a community or local area and will continue to do so unless the heroes destroy or defeat it. This is similar to the master villain of the same name but usually has no master plan - it just wants to kill or destroy or eat. The Ravager ties into the plot in one of several ways: it may be one of many such monsters released by the master villain to damage local rulers; it may have been placed in the heroes' path to slow them down; or it may be an unrelated event but still affects the story because the heroes may kill it to earn the locals' gratitude and help in their quest.,Basilisk or Bulette or Chimera or Cockatrice or Dragon or Ghost or Giant or Gorgon or Jackalwere or Lamia or Leucrotta or Manticore or Owlbear or Peryton or Purple Worm or Spectre or Sphinx or Vampire.
81#85,Reconnaissance Monster,At some point in the adventure the master villain will become aware of the heroes' activities against him. If he has magical abilities or a magical servant then he will send some sort of quiet and clever monster to spy on the heroes. The heroes should have an opportunity to realize they're being spied apon which leads them to a mad scramble as they try to capture or destroy the spy.,Aerial Servant or Succubus or Djinn or Efreet or Homonculus or Imp or Pixie or Pseudo-Dragon or Quasit.
86#90,Stampede,Should the heroes ever cross plains or prairies then their villainous enemies may wish to stampede a herd of large animals at them. Alternatively beasts in the forest may be stampeded by fires set by the villains; in this case it will not be one sort of animal charging through but a mixture of terrified forest animals ranging from the smallest fox-cub to the largest bear.,Buffalo or Bull or Cattle or Herd Animal or Horse or Mammoth or Mastodon.
91#100,Terrain Monster,This is a simple run-in with an animal belonging to the terrain where the heroes are: every type of wilderness has its predators and big and nasty herbivores.,Spider or Giant Scorpion or Bear or Giant Beaver or Boar or Irish Deer or Giant Porcupine or Giant Skunk or Giant Stag or Wolf or Ape or Baboon or Jaguar or Leopard or Lion or Tiger or Axe Beak or Flightless Bird or Hyena or Jackal or Dinosaur or Giant Crab or Giant Crayfish or Crocodile or Giant Frog or Hydra or Giant Lizard.
