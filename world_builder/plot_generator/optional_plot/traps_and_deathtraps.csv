1#10,Animal Pit,This is a classic trap of the adventure genre: the heroes (perhaps just one hero) are dropped into a pit filled with dangerous animals - snakes or lions or bears or whatever. They must either fight the beasts or delay them until they can escape - climb back out or open a secret door or break down a wall or have a rope lowered by friends above or etc.,This is an explorer's trap; it is sprung on heroes exploring an area they think is abandoned or where they think they are unobserved. Remember that the trap can be under observation; if some but not all of the heroes fall into the pit then the ones who remain above can be attacked by the villain's minions.
11#15,Avalanche,"This is an outdoors trap. Some time when the heroes are in a narrow canyon or gorge or are on a snow-covered mountain their enemies can arrange to dump an avalanche upon them (rocks and boulders in the first instance or snow in the second). It's not enough merely to say ""make your saving throw vs Death or be crushed/smothered."" Describe the scene to the heroes as they're traveling along: they feel rather than hear the first groaning and trembling of the earth then hear rocks begin to clatter down upon them/hear the great moaning roar of countless tons of snow beginning to slide down upon them; let them run madly for cover or to get off to the side of the avalanche slippage; just as they're at the most critical stage of their running and just as they're almost to safety and the slide is almost upon them then you can have them make their saves and give them bonuses if they've been clever or really exerted themselves or give them minuses if they've played lackadaisically or just relied on high saving rolls to keep them alive.",In the adventure this is a situation where a single 0-level villain can come near to destroying much more deadly PCs (make sure your characters realize this; perhaps they won't underestimate low-level villains again) and where all the sword-swinging ability in the world won't save the heroes. It also serves to spice up otherwise-uneventful traveling.
16#20,Coliseum,If it's appropriate you can have the heroes captured by the local authorities - particularly when they're in an exotic land or lost world or whatever - and have them armed with gladiatorial gear and dropped into a coliseum for the entertainment of the locals. Note that this works much better with fighting-type heroes than spell-casters. The heroes may be forced to fight animals or monsters or hordes of criminals or - if you wish to be cruel - each other.,This situation has a lot of plot-related potential. If the heroes stay captured for a while then they can become popular gladiators or perhaps leaders of the gladiators and may be able to lead a gladiator escape or even a revolt against the rulers. You can have one of the minor villains also be a prisoner/gladiator and he and his personal PC enemy can fight their final duel in the arena. Big fights in the coliseum are also an invitation for the arrival of Divine Retribution or Natural Disaster climaxes.
21#30,Demolition Zone,In this classic deathtrap the heroes are placed (usually bound and weaponless) in some building or area just as it's due to be destroyed. Some examples: (1) Deep in a mine as it's about to be flooded; (2) in a building at the bottom of a mountain as the villains are preparing to cause an avalanche to fall upon it; (3) In a building as it's set afire and burned to the ground; (4) in a cursed temple as earthquakes are dragging it into the earth or toppling it from a clifftop; (5) In a sinking ship; (6) In a fort just as the final and sure to be successful last attack by the enemy is beginning.,Typically the villains tie the heroes up and leave them in this situation and then run off to escape the calamity. They seldom even look back; when they do it's usually from a great distance. What this means is that the heroes - if they escape - are given a great advantage: the villains may think that they are dead. The heroes have a little time to operate without villain intervention - at least until the villains learn they're still alive.
31#35,Framed,One or more of the heroes is accused and convicted of a capital crime - one for which the mandatory punishment is death. Note that this may be the result of the actions of the Lying Accuser character encounter. The heroes must escape or die and they're escaping from the well-built and well-protected prison of the local authorities. They may either follow the course of actions set out in the Escape goal or they may arrange for friends to break them out at the scene of their execution - always an exciting and dangerous option for there are guards and bloodthirsty crowds handy.,This option serves to make the heroes wanted by the law; you don't want to use this option if the heroes need the cooperation of the authorities to be successful in their quest.
36#45,Mutually Assured Destruction,In this very nasty deathtrap the heroes are bound up in such a manner that any one of them may get free of their bonds - but when they do all their friends perish. For instance - the heroes are all placed in guillotines; the moment that one victim slides up the block pinioning his head all the others lock in place and the blades drop. Obviously the heroes' tasl is to find some way for everyone to get out alive. perhaps an intricate series of cooperative rope-cutting will defuse the trap; perhaps a coordinated maneuver will get everyone free as the trap is being sprung. Warning: don't use this type of trap unless everyone in it cares about everyone else in it! It's an awful temptation for a callous character just to get himself free at the expense of all his companions. After all - once he's free and they're all dead he can loot all their bodies and leave with all their best magical items. Do this only when all those trapped together are friends.,This trap is an opportunity for the heroes to have to work together - it's best done when the heroes have been pursuing their individual initiatives too long and need to be reminded that they're part of a team.
46#65,Pit and the Pendulum,Actually we're applying this term to any of many time-delay deathtraps. In this sort of trap the villains capture the heroes and place them in a trap which will soon kill them - it operates on a delay and often based on a timing device or a burning fuse. Some sample traps include: (1) The Pendulum. This is the bladed pendulum which descends as it sweeps back and forth and will eventually cut the victim(s) in half; they must discover how to get free of their bonds or block and stop the pendulum or (most dangerously) use the swinging pendulum to get them free of their bonds. (2) Moving Walls. Here the walls or ceiling of a room move to crush the heroes; perhaps they're covered with spikes as well. The heroes must figure out how to slow down or stop the crushing walls or must use their lock picking skills to get out before they're crushed or must figure out how to position themselves in the room so that they won't be killed before the room reached its final compressed form. (3) Caged Animal Release. Here the heroes are in a room adjacent to a cage which holds ravenous animals which will kill them; the heroes' cage also holds the mechanism which will release the animals in just a few seconds or minutes. the heroes must figure out how to disarm the release mechanism before the animals are released.,This type of trap is often used by the Master Villain just as he's running off to the final stage of his plan. The heroes have not only to escape the trap but then immediately race to catch up to or intercept the villain.
66#85,Rock and a Hard Place,This trap starts out as an Animal Pit or Pit and the Pendulum or Tomb Deathtrap but an obvious escape suggests itself very early on. If the characters are in an animal pit - for instance - there may be a dark hole in the pit at their chest level; it leads out of the pit. Trouble is that it leads into even worse danger. The hole out of the animal pit may lead to the lair of an even worse animal; it may lead through a succession of dangers (collapsing old catacombs or into an underground river or into a den of zombies) before the heroes reach the light. Sometimes the Master Villain knows about this dangerous escape path; usually though he doesn't; it's an out he didn't know about and which is just coincidentally very dangerous.,Same as that of the type of trap it is associated with.
86#90,Stampede,Should the heroes ever cross plains or prairies then their villainous enemies may wish to stampede a herd of large animals at them. Alternatively beasts in the forest may be stampeded by fires set by the villains; in this case it will not be one sort of animal charging through but a mixture of terrified forest animals ranging from the smallest fox-cub to the largest bear.,In the adventure this is a situation where a single 0-level villain can come near to destroying much more deadly PCs (make sure your characters realize this; perhaps they won't underestimate low-level villains again) and where all the sword-swinging ability in the world won't save the heroes. It also serves to spice up otherwise-uneventful traveling.
91#100,Tomb Deathtraps,Another classic type of trap is the sort of triggered trap left behind in abandoned tombs and ruins and catacombs. Here a hero who touches the wrong step or floor tile or wall brick or torch bracket or mounted gemstone or other device will trigger some sort of ancient trap designed to kill tomb-robbers and intruders. Popular varieties include rooms filling with water or grain or rooms closing for all eternity so that victims starve to death or sliding floors that drop heroes into animal pits (which may or may not be occupied after all this time). It's better to use traps which won't kill heroes immediately such as spike-filled pits tend to do. Give them a chance to use their wits and abilities to escape; make it difficult enough that everyone who survives knows he had to struggle to do it and those who didn't survive know it wasn't a cakewalk.,This type of trap serves to keep heroes on their toes in what would otherwise be very safe-seeming abandoned areas.
