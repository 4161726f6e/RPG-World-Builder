Roll,Master Villain,Description,Character level and abilities
1#5,Agent Provocateur,This master villain is a clever spy who infiltrates an organization and tries to effect its destruction by getting it to perform actions which will cause others to oppose it directly. For instance - he might join a church order and then begin promoting the least-appealing philosophies held by the church (such as racism). By promoting the church's racist philosophies he can bring the church in direct opposition to other races which could lead to armed conflict or chaos or the downfall of the order - all while pretending to be a good member of the order. The identity of this villain is usually a closely guarded secret; the heroes will encounter his covert identity but will not suspect that he's responsible for all this chaos until they start adding up clues. This villain is best used for espionage and mystery adventures.,Experience level around that of party average; character uses brains more than combat ability; often is of thief or related profession.
6#15,Advance Agent,This villain is the vanguard of some sort of invasion; often he is trying to open up a portal to a dimension full of trapped demons and evil gods. He is best used for horror or espionage adventures.,Experience level significantly higher than player-characters' average; often a magic-user or cleric.
16#20,Avenger,This villain seeks to avenge some wrong they think they've suffered. They may be right: they may have suffered a wrong and this makes them a little more sympathetic than villains which are purely evil. The avenger uses their organization - thugs and bribed officials - to get at the one who wronged them and will want either to duel (singly) the one who wronged them or to put the wrongdoer in a deathtrap. They are best used for mystery and revenge adventures; they are less suited to comedy and romance adventures.,Experience level similar to that of the party average (or if the one who did them wrong is a PC then of that character); profession similar to that of the one who did them wrong. They use many minions until the final confrontation with the one they hate.
21#30,Conquerer,This character is moving their army in to take over; that's what they live for. They've been the enemy of your characters' nation's ruler and has launched a full-scale invasion of your characters' favorite nation. The heroes have to beat their way through or elude the horde of soldiers in order to get at the villain; better yet - they might lead their own nation's troops against the villain and outthink them in military fashion. This villain is best-used for wartime and action/adventure scenarios; espionage scenarios (reconnaissance behind enemy lines) also work well.,Experience level at least the party average; probably belongs to one of the fighting character classes.
31#40,Corruptor,This is the villain who wants to make something nasty out of something that is currently nice. They may be working on a small scale - i.e. wish to corrupt one character or a few characters (particularly PCs) and their favorite NPCs. Alternatively they may be a big-scale villain trying to change an entire city or nation into a jaded and debased pit of sin/hatred/death. This character is best used for horror adventures; they also work very well for revenge melodramas (if they have already corrupted someone or some place dear to the player-characters).,Often an evil god or demon - particularly one skilled at magic is very appropriate for this role; in this case the heroes will probably not be striving to kill the villain (which may be impossible) but to thwart their latest plan. If the corruptor is a human or demi-human then they should be a powerful magic-user several experience levels above the PC average. In either case they should have hordes of minions or some spectacular magic that helps them corrupt the righteous.
41#50,Destroyer,This villain is like the Corruptor except that they like to destroy instead of corrupting. They operate like the Conquerer in that they move in their armies - often nonhuman or monstrous armies - and destroy everything in sight. This villain could be an evil god or demon which means that the heroes will have to find the villain's weakness in order to thwart their plan.,Often an evil god or demon - particularly one skilled at magic is very appropriate for this role; in this case the heroes will probably not be striving to kill the villain (which may be impossible) but to thwart their latest plan. If the corruptor is a hu
51#55,God of Chance,"Here you have two options. This villain could be a real entity - an actual god of mischief or silliness who has intruded in the heroes' lives to cause chaos and have fun. Alternatively, this villain could be pure chance: the heroes are having a series of unrelated accidental encounters which cause them fits. No real single villain is involved although it initially looks as though there is. This villain is best used for comedy and romance adventures and is appropriate for most of the other types except horror and revenge.",If a god then godly abilities; otherwise no level or abilities but just powerful coincidence.
56#65,Lovable Rogue,This villain isn't really evil - they're just chaotic and fun. Cheerful bandits in the forest who rob from the rich to give to the poor or singing rope-swinging pirate kings or romantic and sophisticated duelists all belong to the category of the Lovable Rogue. Often the rogue will not be behind the nastiness the heroes are encountering; they may be in competition with them for the prize they're seeking. Often the heroes and the rogue (and their minions) will have to team up to succeed at their task. Just as often the rogue will try to get away with the whole treasure. The rogue is best used in action/adventure or comedy or romance adventures but is fit for just about every scenario.,Experience level similar to PC party average; probably belongs to the fighter or thief or related classes. They usually have a hardy band of adventurers (ranging from one-third to one-half the villain's experience level) devoted to them and working with them.
66#75,Organizer,This villain is the head of the local criminal syndicate - the Thieves' Guild or slaver ring for instance. They're cold-hearted and unsympathetic and human life means nothing to them. They employ assassins and musclemen against the heroes and can only be reasoned with when it's going to profit them more to cooperate with the heroes than just kill them. The Organizer is best used in mystery or espionage or revenge episodes - particularly those with a gangland flavor.,Very low experience level - they use brains and hoods but not their own muscles.
76#85,Ravager,This villain is like the destroyer except they terrorize a very limited area - such as a village or island or castle or clan stronghold. They may want to destroy the whole world but are trapped where they are; perhaps their efforts to free themselves constitute the adventure's plot. They stay in this area and terrorize whatever comes into it. This villain is best used for action/adventure or mystery or horror scenarios.,Varies. They could be a human or a demi-human or a monster. Structure them and their followers so that together they are more than a match for the heroes but the villain alone is not as powerful as the heroes all together.
86#90,Sufferer,This master villain disguises themselves as some other sort of villain. Long ago they were given an ugly curse - they long for death but can never die unless slain by heroes unaware of the curse. Naturally the curse demands that the villain must defend themselves when attacked by the heroes. This villain works hard to make sure the best heroes in the world have sufficient cause to want to come and kill them. They'll insult the heroes or attempt to ruin them or kidnap or murder their loved ones - whatever it takes to bring the heroes against them. Often they can only die in one specific holy place so the heroes will need to be lured there. If the heroes are doing research on the villain all this time then they may find out about the curse - leading to a sad and painful end to the episode as the unkillable villain has to leave and find someone new to kill them. This villain works best in serious adventures - especially straight action/adventure or horror or mystery (who is this and why are they doing these things?) and revenge.,This villain should have fighting ability as great as that of the best fighter in the party and may have magic and minions as well - but they cannot be killed by mortal hands except under the special circumstances listed above.
91#100,Zealot,"This villain is like the conquerer but he's not trying to conquer to own; he's trying to purge the world of something he feels is pure evil (another religion or race of sentient beings or a custom). He operates just like the Conquerer - enslaving or killing all those who belong to the ""wrong"" race or philosophy. Adventures against him are similar to those of the Conquerer; it's only his own goals that are different. Warfare and revenge and action/adventure or espionage are all very appropriate scenario types.",Experience level at least the party average; probably belongs to one of the fighting character classes.
