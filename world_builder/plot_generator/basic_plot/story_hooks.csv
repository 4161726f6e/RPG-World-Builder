Roll,Story Hook,Description
1#20,Dying Delivery,"On some occasion when the hero is out wandering the streets or is otherwise all alone; a dying person bumps into them and hands them something. Tey say a few words and then die. The deliverer can be dying of a curse or poison or a wound from a weapon or malnutrition brought on by their long captivity. Or it can be some bizarre and inexplicable cause. The dagger still protruding from their back is the most common cause of death among dying deliverers. The object given to the hero can be a famous weapon or artifact which has long been missing and presumed destroyed - an object which could not possibly have found its way into this wretch's hands (such as the king's crown or the most holy talisman of the local church). It could be a sheaf of papers which could signify any number of things; it can be a certificate of birth which proves that some nobody is the heir to the kingdom (naturally the agents of the current heir will kill anyone who possesses it); it can be proof that an upstanding citizen is really the head of the city's criminal syndicate (the said upstanding citizen is very anxious to get hands on those papers); it can be a duplicate scroll describing a ritual of monstrous demon-summoning whose elements are reminiscent of events going on right now in the city. The person's dying words are the real hook. In general they should tell the hero where to look next. If they name their killer then the hero will know to go take a look at the accused. If they describe where they were attacked then the hero will probably go there. If they tell the hero where to take this macguffin then the hero will probably go there (even if they aren't necessarily inclined to hand over the goods). If they say something inexplicable such as ""Emerald eyes of the ram"" before dying then the hero will be baffled - until later when they hear of the golden statue of a ram with emerald eyes being commissioned by some famous personage."
21#30,Grim Necessity,"If the hero doesn't involve themselves with this adventure then they will find themselves suffering or dead - period. That's the hook to bring them into the adventureâ€¦ but you have to determine why they'll suffer or die if they don't become involved. Some options: (1) They've been cursed or geased by some powerful caster of spells to accomplish some deed that leads them into the adventure. If you choose this option then make a note of the fact that the hero may want to exact revenge on the spell-caster at the story's end or in another adventure. (2) They've been falsely accused or even convicted of a crime. The authorities are hunting them wherever they go - and they have magic-using allies so the hero can't count on staying out of their clutches forever. They must pursue the clues that lead into the adventure or they'll forever be a fugitive. (3) They've been poisoned and have only a few days to find the antidote or perish. According to their alchemist and wizard friends this potent magical poison can't be cured by clerical magic and will destroy their body upon death so they can't be raised. Additionally, any clone made of them will be similarly poisoned."
31#40,Hero Offended,Someone greatly offends the hero - so much so that they'll pursue their offender right into the adventure. Note that this usually means that the offender is a minion of the Master Villain. You'll have to decide whether the minion offended the hero precisely to bring them into the adventure or just as a side-effect of their ordinary villain activities. Ways for the NPC to offend our hero include: (1) They can injure or kill someone well-liked or loved of the hero. This is best done when the hero isn't around or simply isn't in a position to pursue the villain. (2) They can steal or destroy some important property of the hero such as a magical weapon or a family heirloom. (3) They can cheat the hero. This is fun and requires some role-playing time as the villain (pretending to be a legitimate merchant or professional) convinces the hero to buy some wondrous thing - property or a title or a magical potion of irresistible attraction - and then makes off with the fortune paid by the hero before the hero realizes they've been had.
41#50,Legend and Rumor,In this classic story hook the hero stumbles across some new or long-forgotten knowledge that promises great treasure or gain. Some of these sorts of rumors include: (1) Exact placement of a legendary site. In an old musty rare document the hero comes across clues leading to the exact placement of some famous legendary site. This is usually best for wizards and clerics to find as they're heavier readers than other types of characters. The site must be famous for some treasure or other thing that the heroes will want. (2) Legendary danger site. This sort of legend can be heard from the locals at taverns and inns near the site. Some place - a valley or ruined castle or lake - is locally notorious for being dangerous and having some sort of treasure. Thile it is widely known it is sufficiently dangerous that no one has ever solved its mysteries. (3) Jump now look later. Magical researches lead a wizard-character to be able to recreate some famous magical spell or effect - but the character doesn't exactly know what's going to happen: their damaged scroll doesn't precisely say. They need to assemble some stout friends and conduct the ritual to find out why it's so famous. It could transport them to an alternate plane or world or awaken a god who should have been left to sleep or complete some incredibly powerful eons-old spell effect which could change the world.
51#55,Mistaken Identity,The hero could be mistaken by one villain for another villain involved in the master plot. This has good comic potential if the hero and the missing villain are in fact so similar that no one can tell them apart. In this case one villain will tell our hero something cryptic and important about the current state of the master plan and then leave which prompts our heroes to investigate.
56#65,Mystery Woman,"Create an NPC ""mystery woman"" sure to be fascinating to your hero and have her keep appearing inexplicably in their life. As they become interested and investigate her they keep stumbling across the villain's plans and becomes inextricably mired in the plot. A mystery man is just as useful. You'll need to decide just what the mystery woman is. Some choices: (1) Adventurer. The woman could be involved to turn a profit for herself; she could end up stealing the grand treasure out from under the hero's nose. (2) Agent. She could be a secret agent for the local authorities; when this is the case it's usually best to make sure the hero becomes suspicious of her because she never tells the truth about her origins and motives. Only at the end when she produces the king's warrant will the hero fond out her true profession and motivations. (3) Ghost. The woman could actually be some undead spirit - not a kill-crazed ghost but an intelligent spirit who wants to help the heroes along in order to redress some old crime. Make sure that it's a non-magical hero who becomes interested in her and that she only appears in the most unusual of places and circumstances (in ruins or the dark or away from other people). (4) Innocent endangered by villain. In this classic role the woman is in danger from the villain but can never seem to stay around long enough to tell the hero precisely why. The hero becomes enmeshed in the plot as they pursue her to find out. (5) Lover or daughter of villain. Here the character is a concubine or daughter of the villain but really prefers the hero; bound by honor to help the villain but nonetheless provides aid to the hero whenever she can. The tragic example of this role gets killed by the villain in the climax; the happily-ever-after variety is rescued by the hero."
66#80,Old Enemy,This is a straightforward story hook: the hero learns that their oldest enemy is back and very active in the campaign. The hero will naturally want to investigate and will walk right into the story.
81#90,Old Friend,"The childhood friend of the hero shows up in one of several ways to drag the hero into the story. Some of the ways include: (1) He asks for help. The friend shows up to ask the hero for help. He or his family is being menaced by some side-effect of the villain's plan. The old friend could actually be a traitor and lead the hero straight into danger.) (2) He is killed. The friend dies on the hero's doorstep; the hero is obligated to investigate. There will be enough clues found on the friend's body to lead the hero into the plot. (As an interesting variant, the old friend could have become a villain and been killed by an NPC hero which leads to some confusion on the PC's part.)"
91#100,Pressing Buttons,"As a general story hook approach you can think about the player-character - their personal goals and personal dislikes. If the hero is pursuing a specific goal the you can have one of the minor villains thwart the hero's latest step toward that goal as a side-effect of the villain's master plan. If they are a wizard developing a spell then the villains can steal aa their notes and components; if they're a soldier seeking advancement in rank then the villains can discredit them and get their own soldier advanced to that rank; if they're a social climber wooing a high-ranking individual then the villain can do that as well. Any of these tricks will cause the hero to dislike the villains mightily and the hero will investigate the villain right into the depths of the plot. Alternatively if there's something the hero truly hates to see then that can happen with the villains responsible for the act. If the hero has established that they protect children, have one of the villains endanger or harm a child within the hero's sight. If it's political corruption the hero hates then have them see a friend or relative unjustly sentenced by a crooked magistrate. Their inevitable investigations will lead them into the story."
