Roll,NPC,Description,Character level and abilities
1#10,Absent-Minded Expert,The characters find they need an expert in some field - pottery or alchemy or whatever - but all they can find is a somewhat daffy and absent-minded master of the subject. They are useful when around their subject matter but otherwise are absent-minded and incautious and in frequent need of rescuing.,Normal man/woman with appropriate skills
11#15,Arrogant Snob,"For some reason the heroes have to accompany or escort an arrogant nobleman or crafts-master. They can't afford to abandon or kill this person; they may be their employer or an expert on the place they're going toor one of their relatives or a relative of the royal family. This person makes their life hell with sniping comments and haughtiness and other undesirable traits. You can have this snob be unbearable all through the adventure or gradually learn from the heroes the worth of ""lesser persons"" - perhaps that's why this person was sent along with the heroes in the first place.",Normal man/woman with appropriate skills
16#20,Childhood Friend with a Dark Secret,One of the heroes is accompanied by one of their childhood friendsâ€¦ but said friend now has a dark secret. They do strange and mysterious things (sneaks off to send messages or behaves strangely around certain NPCs or is scared to death of certain harmless animals or situations) and will not explain why to their PC friend until late in the story. The childhood friend could now be a villain or perhaps the master villain is blackmailing them to perform some actin against the heroes - or he could just be insane.,Experience level just below the characters' party average
21#25,Congenial Madman,This fellow is  a pleasant and happy lunatic whom the heroes encounter; after the initial encounter he follows them wherever they go and comments on their plans while behaving strangely or getting underfoot and - very occasionally - proving to be a real help. In reality this person could actually be a madman or a god in mortal guise or a villain working for the master villain or an agent for a friendly power helping the heroes.,Normal man/woman with no abilities to speak of; if a spy then has an experience level equal to PC party average; if a god then normal divine abilities.
26#35,Crusty Old Professional,The heroes need an expert in a certain field - a craft or art such as blacksmithing or engineering. The only or best professional they can find is an aged expert. They're crusty and cranky and sharp-tongued; they constantly complain about food and weather and their companions and the decline in skill of their co-workers since they were young and the rotten pay and so on. You can have them actually possess a heart of gold or be just as nasty as they sound.,Experience level just below the characters' party average
36#40,Gibbering Madman,Some poor wretch blundered into part of the master villain's plan and saw too much. What they saw drove them crazy. They gibber and jabber while occasionally uttering clues about what they've seen but it just isn't coherent. They know enough that the heroes will need to take them along to comment on what they're encountering though - they can't just be met and then forgotten. This gives you an opportunity for some real wall-climbing role-playing as you portray this frayed-nerved and wide-eyed human wreckage.,Normal man/woman with no abilities to speak of.
41#45,Government Observer,For some reason the heroes' ruler wants one of their own people accompanying them. It may be that the ruler has hired them for a task; it may be that they're in trouble and have to be monitored; it may be that they are so good at what they do that the ruler insists that the observer must accompany them to see how they do it. Whatever the reason the heroes are now stuck with a haughty and self-important royal observer who is an expert in (probably) military tactics or espionage. They continually offer unwanted advice (you can make it good advice if they need it or bad advice it it is time for them to be captured or commit a blunder) and tends to get the heroes into trouble by pulling rank whenever they aren't satisfied.,Experience level just below the characters' party average
46#50,Hero-Worshipper,Some youth - an urchin or a sibling of one of the heroes or a child run away from home - hooks up with the heroes and follows them wherever they go - being admiring and talking to everyone (neutrals and villains included) about how wonderful and powerful the heroes are.,Normal man/woman with no abilities to speak of.
51#60,Ingenue in Distress,The heroes must protect some defenseless young innocent who is in danger from the villains. This person - perhaps the sheltered son or daughter of a nobleman or merchant - has no abilities at all but is sweet and charming and in great need of help.,Normal man/woman with no abilities to speak of.
61#65,Inquisitive Chronicler,This character is a historian who wishes to accompany the heroes to record their exploits. They constantly pry into the heroes' backgrounds and ask questions that are none of their business as the adventure continues.,Experience level half that of the party average; excellent scribe and writer.
66#75,Merry Minstrel,This character follows the heroes in order that they might find inspiration for their song and storytelling. They can't be shut up; they sing all the day long and into the night and is a showoff before crowds and is far too noisy for a party trying to remain unobserved.,Experience level half that of the party average; fine minstrel abilities.
76#80,Obsequious Merchant,This person is the owner of the caravan the heroes are protecting or the merchant the heroes encounter when they desperately need to buy something. They are oily and ever-flattering and overly agreeable and are a sharp bargainer; the heroes will not find them willing to give them a sale price.,Normal man/woman with bargaining abilities and a certain amount of wealth.
81#85,Romantic Loony,Somewhere the heroes bump into a lunatic who falls immediately in love with a PC and won't leave them alone. This character may be a love-smitten village lass or nebbishy adventurer. Whatever the origin this character must be hopelessly in love with the character but have some trait which keeps the PC from reciprocating; perhaps the loony is too plain or too crazed or too stupid. He or she really is sincere in their affection for the character.,Experience level at one-half party average or at party average.
86#90,Talkative Barkeep,This classic encounter is the garrulous innkeeper who has information the characters want; trouble is they'll have to bribe them to get it or agree to stay at the inn or buy a lavish meal or listen to their incessant stories about their career in the army or so on.,Normal man/woman with inn-keeping skills.
91#95,Tragic Fellow Hero,The heroes are in the company of some hero well-known to them; they may have been a companion or ally or they may just know of them by reputation. They are a tragic figure; they may have lost their family to the master villain or lost their properties and titles or be afflicted with a curse they cannot be rid of or be committed to a quest they know will take their life. They are dour and gloomy and prophesize doom while having no fun at all.,Experience level at about the party average or slightly above
96#100,Villain Ally,For some reason the heroes find themselves in the company of a villain. Perhaps they're a minion of this adventure's master villain; they may be guiding the heroes to wherever they must leave a ransom or if the master villain is forcing the heroes to perform some mission then this villain ally is along to make sure they do it right. Whatever the reason - they are competent and unpredictable and out for themselves.,Experience level at about party average.
