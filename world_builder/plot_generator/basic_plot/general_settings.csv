Roll,General Setting,Description
1#5,Alternate Plane,Most of the story takes place in an alternate dimension; this implies that either the PCs or the villains (or both) have magic powerful enough to bridge the dimensional barrier (or the PCs stumble across some portal). This setting gives you opportunities to introduce new magic/spells/monsters/treasures and wholly different cultures.
6#25,Cosmopolitan City,Most of the story takes place in a large sophisticated city; center the villain's plot and activities around that city. This setting is best suited to adventures involving more people than monsters; most of your villains should be human or demi-human.
26#45,Exotic Distant Land,This adventure will take the heroes to some fascinating and exotic distant country where they'll have to cope with new customs and unfamiliar monsters along with very colorful NPC encounters. Choose one of the more fascinating foreign lands from your campaign world. This setting gives you the opportunity to plop your heroes down in interesting or uncomfortable or dangerous situations arising from their unfamiliarity with local laws and customs.
46#50,Hero's Home Town,The action takes the heroes back to the home territory of one of them. Note this usually means that this hero's family or old friends are deeply involved in the adventure. This setting allows you to give the hero nostalgia episodes where they trip across places and people who were important in their youth and can observe the changes to them. It also adds a sense of importance to otherwise casual events. A character should take a dim view of a villain threatening a town full of their dearest friends.
51#70,On the Road,Most of the adventure takes place on the road as the heroes are traveling from place to place. This is especially good for adventures where heroes are investigating a wide-ranging mystery or are part of a caravan or are being pursued by loathsome villains. This setting allows you to showcase lots of different in a short amount of real time; each separate encounter can take place in a different nation.
71#80,On the Sea,Most of the action occurs on the sea - the heroes are shipborne for some reason and dock in lots of ports. This is good for adventures where the heroes are investigating clues left all over the map or are part of some trading enterprise or are being pursued by villains. This setting allows you to batter the heroes with mighty and terrifying storms. They can be menaced by unusual and spectacular sea monsters and annoyed by pirates and buccaneers.
81#90,Torturous Terrain,The adventure takes place in some sort of unsettled and uncivilized or otherwise dangerous terrain; in action stories the desert and jungle work best; choose one of those two or decide on a setting that is similarly dangerous and exotic. In this setting the heroes have to contend with their villainous foes but they also have to deal with the inhabitants of the region and the effort of just staying alive in a dangerous or unfamiliar climate.
91#95,Under the Ground,In this variety of adventure the heroes descend into vast cavern networks beneath the earthen crust. There they can encounter bizarre races and primitive tribes as well as hitherto-unknown monsters and strange landscapes. This setting allows you to present the heroes with new encounters and they may also need to find some way to escape the setting - the exit door is not always clearly marked.
96#100,Under the Sea,This sort of high-fantasy adventure takes place in and under (not on top of) the sea. The heroes require access to some sort of magic item or spell that allows them to breathe underwater for long stretches and might adventure in the uncharted depths or perhaps in a community of sea-breathers.
