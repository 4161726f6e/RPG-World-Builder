6#10,Escape,Early in the adventure the heroes are captured. The remainder of the adventure consists of them learning enough so that they can escape. They have to get to know their fellow prisoners; learn the prison's routine; inventory their possessions; acquire other possessions they need; plan an escape; and execute it.
11#19,Explore a New Area,The heroes are hired or convinced to enter an unmapped area and explore it. They may be making a map; they may be trying to find someone who disappeared into this area in the past; they may be following legends that tell of treasure in the unexplored interior.
20#25,Encounter Old Villain,If your campaign has a villain who shows up again and again to bedevil the heroes then this is an episode featuring that villain. You might wish to roll once again to see what the villain's goal is.
26#35,Gain Money,The heroes are intent on acquiring a fee or treasure. If it's a fee you may roll again to learn the patron's goal. If it's a treasure then consult the Setting which will dictate where the treasure is.

They may be looking for an artifact or weapon or are performing a mission for someone who will reward them with political power (a higher social rank or lands as an example).
