Roll,Climax,Description
1#10,Bloody Battle,This is the best climax for an adventure involving the clash of mighty armies - or for any adventure where (toward the end) the master villain and a large body of minions confront the heroes and their own troops. This finale is characterized by a monstrous clash between the two forces with the heroes chewing through the enemy ranks to get at the master villain and his elite guards. It's strenuous and exciting and classically simple.
11#30,Chase to Ground,First you have heroes chasing the villain. The villain - after a series of encounters with the heroes - is running to safety to some place where he can acquire more power or to somewhere he can accomplish some dread purpose such as assassination or mass murder. The heroes chase him and have to deal with the obstacles he leaves behind and finally catch up to him before or just as he reaches his goal. Here we have the final duel between the villain's forces and the heroes. Second you have the villain chasing the heroes. Often in a story like this the heroes have found out how to defeat the villain - such as getting to a particular temple and conducting a particular ritual. The villain chases them all through their quest and catches up to them just as they're commencing their ritual; they must (with heroic effort) conclude the ritual while suffering his attacks. Third you have the master villain's sudden escape attempt. This takes place in adventures where the master villain's identity is unknown until the end. His identity is revealed and he makes a sudden bolt for freedom; the heroes give chase. This usually results in a dangerous foot-chase through nasty terrain - such as across rooftops or through dungeons or across an active battlefield.
31#40,Divine Retribution,Here the heroes' goal has been to alert the gods that the master villain threatens them or their plans; in the last scenes of the adventure - as our heroes face an overwhelming enemy force - the gods bring down their divine retribution on the villain by causing a massive earthquake or tidal wave or lightning storm or flood of monsters. This is all well and good but the heroes are too close and must escape the fringe effects of this awesome disaster. A variant on this is the natural disaster. No gods are actually involved but the master villain has been tampering with the delicate forces of nature. He may have been powering his master spell with the energies of a volcano - when the heroes attack the scene of his spell-casting the spell goes out of control and so does the volcano. The villain is consumed in the eruption and the heroes must escape or be consumed themselves.
41#60,Prevented Deed,Here the heroes have been defeated - captured by the master villain or so thoroughly cut up by his minions that all believe them to be dead. And the heroes have learned - from the bragging of the villain or loose talk of his minions or examination of clues - what is the crucial event of his master plan. The battered and bruised heroes must race to this site and have their final confrontation with the villain - bursting in on him and his minions just as the knife or final word or key is poised - and prevent the awful deed from taking place and defeat the master villain and minions who beat them previously.
61#80,Scattered Duels,In this climax the heroes have gotten to the end of their quest - they may have broken into or sneaked into or escaped from imprisonment within the villain's citadel or have marched right into the little town where the villain is holed up - and they become separated. You can separate them by having traps and tricks break the party apart or by having them see two or three things they must resolve (such as danger to innocents or the appearance of minion villains) pop up simultaneously; they'll have to run in all directions at the same time or suffer failure. Once the party is broken down into bite-sized chunks you confront each individual or small group with the enemy or enemies he most deserves to face - his personal enemy or the monster which defeated him before as examples - for a grand series of climatic duels. This works best when the master villain is one which can be dueled; if he's a demon or god then the heroes may need an artifact to fight him.
81#100,Throne-Room Duel,This is set up much like the scattered duels except that you don't separate the heroes. It's harder to control whom fights who in this situationâ€¦ but if it doesn't matter who has the final duel with the master villain then this is a classic climax choice.
