Roll,Minor Villain,Description,Character level and abilities
1#5,Avenger,This character is much like the master villain of the same name but he's not in charge of all this villainy and he's definitely an enemy of one of the PCs. You'll have to decide who he is and why he hates on of the heroes; he could be anything from a recurring villain to someone who simply lost a fight to the hero once. The Avenger works mostly in the field and bedevils the heroes as they seek out the master villain; he can be slain earlier in the adventure but otherwise ends up fighting the hero he hates in the adventure's climax. The Avenger can seldom be converted to the heroes' cause.,The Avenger is usually a fighter or of a related character class and of an experience level similar to that of the best fighter in the players' group.
6#15,Chief Assassin,The Chief Assassin is the favorite killer of the master villain. The Assassin works mostly in the field - first killing witnesses who might prove harmful to his master and then zeroing in on the PCs. He usually meets his end before the adventure's climax but he may take one of the heroes down with him. The Assassin can seldom be converted to the heroes' cause; he has no respect for life and likes killing too much. He will flee if he sees his master killed.,This villain is usually a thief or assassin at about the average level of the PC party; he may be a monster instead.
16#20,Childhood Friend with a Dark Secret,"Similar to the master villain of the same name, he may not wish to be helping the master villain; his family may be held hostage or he may just be too frightened of the villain or otherwise weak-willed to refuse. Alternatively he could have turned evil. This villain usually pals around with the heroes in the early part of the adventure then steals something important from them or otherwise harms them and scurries home to his master. He's encountered again just before or during the adventure's climax where he must fight his childhood friend - the PC hero. This villain can often be converted to the heroes' cause; after all, he is an old friend of one of them. But the decision usually costs him his life as the master villain shoots him in the back for his treachery.",Experience level similar to the average level in the PC's party; this character is usually a simple fighter.
21#25,Corrupted Hero,This villain was once a hero - possibly one known to the players. He ws seduced b the dark side of the dungeon master. Because of his own weakness or of a curse he has become a villain and a pawn of the master villain. Usually the heroes encounter him once or twice - long before reaching the adventure's climax - and have inconclusive fights with him; it's best when he can duel one hero who recognizes him and then can get away to safety. It may be that he is now committed to evil; it may be that he's ambivalent. If the latter is the case then he will have a big choice to make when the story's climax comes around. If he chooses for the heroes then he is likely to die at the hands of the master villain.,Same character class and approximately the same experience level as any one of the more powerful party members - especially the one most likely to have heard of him or be a friend of his.
26#30,Coward,This character is an ordinary grunt minion of the master villain but he is a coward. He's deathly afraid of the villain and the heroes. He's best used when you plan to have the heroes captured; by his mannerisms you can make it clear to them that his fellow is a coward and they will begin to work on him psychologically. He can't be converted to the heroes' way of thinking - he's too afraid - but they can convince him to help them if they persuade him that he will be completely safe from the master villains retribution. Of course he probably won't be.,Usually a fighter several levels below the PC's party average level.
31#40,Hard-Eyed Advisor,This is the sort of villain whom the heroes see in the master villain's throne room. He's hard-eyed and scary; life means nothing to him and he enjoys killing. He's also a good advisor to his master. He can't be converted to the heroes' way of thinking. He likes what he does too much.,This villain is usually a magic-user or cleric at an experience level close to that of the most powerful PCs. He's tricky and probably has some magical items to boost his combat abilities.
41#50,Inquisitor,This villain is the one who interrogates the heroes and the NPCs captured by the villains. He accompanies the other minor villains out into the field and works on anyone captured; he enjoys inflicting pain and suffering. He can't be converted to the heroes' way of thinking.,This villain is usually an assassin at an experience level close to that of the most powerful PCs. He's a sneaky fighter perhaps with magical weapons.
51#60,Lovable Rogue,"This character is like the master villain of the same name except he has no minions of his own and serves at someone else's bidding.He's independent and does not always work in his employer's best interests; he often makes fun of the master villain's pretensions and may suffer that villain's retaliation because of it. It is possible to convert the rogue to the heroes' cause; if they offer him money or action/adventure or a pardon for past crimes or even if there's an attractive PC who appeals to him then he may be tempted over to their side. If he isn't, he'll abandon his employer during the climax and escape to safety.",The Rogue is probably a fighter or thief at a level similar to the average PC level.
61#65,Misguided Moralist,This fellow has been convinced that only by helping the villain achieve the master plan can he improve the world. He tends to be encountered all through the adventure's plot - usually escaping from the heroes and taunting them for their wrong thinking. Fortunately he's no more effective as a villain than he is as a thinker. It's very hard to covert him to the heroes' cause; he's too wrapped up in his own cause. It can be done if the heroes can demonstrate that the master villain has lied to him.,This character is usually a fighter or cleric at a few levels less experienced than the average PC.
66#75,Mistress/Daughter with a Heart of Gold,"This character is much like the ""lovable daughter of the villain"" type of mystery woman from the story hooks suggestion. In this case she usually accompanies the master villain but sometimes goes on missions of her own where she runs into and develops affection for one of the PCs. This sort of minor villain is easiest to convert to the heroes' cause but - especially if she's not the villain's daughter - she may suffer his wrath at the story's climax when he finds out she has been helping his foes.",Probably a thief or magic-user at experience level one-half the party level.
76#85,Moronic Muscleman,This fellow is a huge and powerful monster of a fighter. His job is to smash anything the villain tells him to smash. He does that very well but don't ask him to do any thinking; he has no time for such brainy stuff. He cannot be converted to the heroes' cause; he has a blind and unswerving and perhaps magic-induced loyalty to his master. The Moronic Muscleman doesn't have to be human. He can be a zombie or a golem or an animated statue or some horrible manlike creature. He is encountered in the field - usually as the servant of the adventure's other minor villain; if he survives her is usually on hand at the adventure's climax.,Experience level equal to or just over the party average; incredible strength.
86#95,Single-Minded Soldier,The most trustworthy of villain minions is the experienced and competent and persistent soldier - a field-trained officer who serves the villain with military precision. He is usually encountered in the field as leader of the villain's field operations. He is not encountered directly until the middle of or the latter part of the adventure; until then the heroes encounter only his subordinates. It's very hard to convert the soldier to the heroes' cause; he usually doesn't have any conscience worth mentioning.,Usually a fighter equal in experience to the party average; has superior planning abilities.
96#100,Sniveling Vizier,The Vizier is a throne-room villain. Functionally he's rather like the Hard Eyed Advisor - offering tactics and advice to his master; but he's an oily and sleazy and cowardly sycophant. He's usually brilliant in his field of advice but has no combat abilities. He cannot be converted to the heroes' cause but can be convinced to abandon or betray his master in order to save his own hide. This is best done when the heroes break into the master villain's throne room; the vizier would have to muster up a lot of courage to confront them.,Usually a normal man or woman with no abilities to speak of other than planning abilities and political influence.
