Roll,Specific Setting,Description
1#5,Catacombs,These can be catacombs beneath a living city or a ruined one; they can be long-forgotten or still in use.
6#10,Caves of Magical Folk,These can be either beautiful and glittering homes of gorgeous magical peoples or the dank and terrifying lairs of horrible monsters.
11#20,Classic Dungeon,This would be the standard monster-filled labyrinth; perhaps it's a nesting ground for the master villain's monster troops.
21#23,Craftsmen's Chambers,This can occur in either the shop of the master craftsman of a palace or manor or the guild-area of the city.
24#33,Demi-human Community,In wilderness areas this will be a large community of demi-humans or intelligent nonhumans such as orcs. If your action is taking place in a city then this could be a hidden community (such as a secret underground dwarf community) or a section of the city inhabited mostly by demi-humans.
34#35,Laboratory,This can be the alchemical lab of a friendly wizard or the horrible experimental chamber of the villain where new monsters are created and released upon the world.
36#40,Legendary Forest,This classic adventure site is the sometimes dark and fearsome and sometimes light and cheerful yet always magical and incomprehensible forest inhabited by the oldest elven tribes and most terrifying monsters.
41#45,Lost City,This is the remnant of some lost civilization or expedition which is still thriving in some forgotten corner of the world. Remnants of lost civilizations can even inhabit cavern systems beneath campaign cities and prey upon the above-worlders for their goods/slaves/sacrifices.
46#50,Madman's Fortress,This is the citadel of a major enemy; strong and unassailable and filled with soldiers and monsters. Lined with secret passages and deathtraps. This is not a wholesome place for adventurers to spend their time.
51#52,Magical Lake,This is the aquatic equivalent of the Legendary Forest where a beautiful and glistening yet treacherous and dangerous environment is filled with water-breathing magical folk.
53#62,Mansion of Powerful NPC,This can be the home of a villain - the characters may have to break in and rescue someone or steal evidence or break out if they have been captured - or of a heroic ally in which case it may be used as the headquarters for the heroes' plans and activities.
63#67,Military Encampment,This is best used in an episode involving warfare; it could be the good-guy army's encampment from which the heroes launch their adventures or the villain's encampment in which case the heroes might have to sneak in on a mission or escape from it if they're captured.
68#72,Palace of the Ruler,The heroes could be here for many different reasons: trying to get a favor from the ruler or part of some nobleman's retinue. They could be members of the palace guard or sneaking in to assassinate the ruler or thrown into the dungeon for crimes they did or dod not commit.
73#77,Ruins,These can be the ruins of some ancient civilization or an abandoned temple/castle or incomprehensible blocks of stone arranged by ancient gods. They can be magical or normal. They can be inhabited by ordinary animals or monsters as centers of magic or just tumbled-down buildings.
78#80,Shacktown of the Oppressed,Part of the action centers around the tenements or shacks of the worst part of town; perhaps an allied NPC lives here or the characters are fugitives hiding out in the nasty part of town.
81#90,Tavern/Inn,This is a classic fantasy setting - the residence of traveling heroes and the home of the tavern brawl.
91#100,Temple/Church,This can be either the church of some lofty and good deity or the dark and grisly temple of some horrid deity (doubtless filled with evil soldiers and monsters) or even the temple that the madman villain has dedicated to himself for when he becomes a god.
