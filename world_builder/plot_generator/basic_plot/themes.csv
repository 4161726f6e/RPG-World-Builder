Roll,Theme,Description,Characteristics,Ground Rules
1#40,Action-Adventure,This is the most common and straightforward sort of adventure there is. In this scenario you present your characters with a task and then confront them with obstacles to overcome in order to accomplish the task successfully.,Monsters; natural disasters; human enemies; many opportunities for the characters to show off their combat abilities and other skills.,None.
41#50,Comedy,This adventure is fun for fun's sake. Its basic purpose is to provide humorous entertainment with a minimum of actual danger or tragedy.,Plans that go horribly awry (for both heroes and villains); strange encounters; peculiar NPCs and monsters; witty dialogue; generally non-lethal encounters and situations.,NPCs and villains should be more amusing than menacing: bumbling; witty or just strange. Even a very frightening villain should have some crack in their armor - a silly mannerism; a pretentious habit; a mental aberration (such as a sensitivity about their large nose).
51#65,Espionage,Espionage adventures are active and grim scenarios involving spying and perhaps other cloak-and-dagger deeds such as assassination or rescue.,Characters are resented with a task and must devise an intricate and clever plan to accomplish the task. Other characteristics include grim and efficient enemies; betrayal; and many stealth-related encounters. Thieves; assassins and rangers are especially useful.,The task often calls for a minimum of bloodshed - i.e. the more people the characters kill; the less successful the mission.
66#80,Horror,This type of adventure is designed to scare both the characters and the players. Just having a monster attack is not enough for a horror theme; the monster must first frighten the characters.,Dark; musty; old settings; things creeping around in the dark; terrified NPCs; violent weather; inexplicable monsters.,Use psychology to frighten the characters (keep creeping or shambling things at the very edges of their perception; tell them they have the feeling of something watching them; etc.); don't use any monster exactly as written (give it strange abilities and behavior the characters can't predict).
81#85,Mystery,Here characters are presented with a mystery - often a murder - and have to find out who did what to whom.,A murder or other crime; a macguffin to force the characters to investigate the crime; frequent (usually non-violent) interaction with civilian authorities.,None.
86#90,Revenge,In this adventure some villain has so offended one or more of the characters that they cannot be suffered to live. (Alternatively the injured party could hire the characters to avenge their honor.) The villain must be found or otherwise gotten at - setting up the final duel or showdown between villain and characters.,The Insult (character or NPC must be mortally offended; the villain could steal their property; injure or kill their friend; lie to or about the character; etc.). This is a grim sort of adventure characterized by strong emotions and violent encounters.,None.
91#95,Romance,This sort of adventure (rarely played but worthwhile anyway) has as its central plot the romance between two characters - usually a player character and a NPC.,You start with romantic interest between the characters and then you strew the road to love with obstacles. Some examples: someone kidnaps one of the lovers; a lying NPC convinces one lover of something awful about the other; one lover finds they have to settle an old debt by marrying another; one lover belongs to a profession the other cannot stand (make sure it's one the character is not willing to abandon without suffering); the lovers are from different social backgrounds and are opposed by both their families and society at large.,None.
96#100,Roll Twice,Roll twice and ignore further rolls of 96-00.,,
