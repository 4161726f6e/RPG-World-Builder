Roll,Plot,Description
1#20,ABC Quest,This is an epic sort of plot. In it the heroes are given (or undertake) a task to perform: the taking of a city or the rescue of an innocent or the destruction of a monster or the creation of a magical item or the defeat of the master villain or so on. The path to victory is not an easy one. To get to their goal (event A) they find that they must first accomplish some other task - event B. But when they undertake the task of accomplishing event B they find they must first accomplish task C. This goes on for several encounters until the heroes accomplish all the obstacle events which prevent them from returning to event A - their original goal. For instance the heroes decide that they must attack and destroy the demon Hashkoreth in his mountaintop stronghold. But legend has it that Haskkoreth can only be defeated by the sword forged for this task and that sword was thrown ages ago into the Gorge of Doom. Here the heroes find that they can only descend if they wear special armor forged by dwarf-kings several centuries ago. When they confront the current dwarf-king he says he will give them the armor only if they defeat the great dragon which is ravaging his land. And so on.
21#40,Accumulation of Elements,In this sort of plot the heroes have to go from place to place - perhaps covering very little area like a city or perhaps roaming the known world - and accumulate elements to be used against the master villain. These elements may be clues (revealing the identity of the villain) or pieces of an artifact (the one which can destroy the villain) or evidence (which will persuade someone to act against the master villain) or allies (which will allow the heroes to win the war).
41#60,Event,"For this plot you can choose some sort of event - a tournament or a holiday or a celebration called by the king or a masked ball - and set the commencement of the master villain's plan against that backdrop. For instance, assume the master villain is the Organizer (a crime boss). He's picked this event as the time for some important crime: the assassination of a noble or theft of some immense treasure as an example. You contrive to have the heroes present at the event; you go through one or two of the event's incidents (duels at a tournament for  example); and then the master plan gets under way and the characters begin seeing clues to alert them that something is wrong. The event continues as they investigate; it provides an interesting backdrop to their activities. With luck the heroes will put together enough clues to discover what's afoot and thwart the plan."
61#80,Geographic Progressions,This is the simplest sort of adventure plot. The heroes have an area to investigate or travel through; they have encounters based on where they are. For instance there is the traditional dungeon where monsters are tied to a specific room or area. Or if the heroes are traveling along a narrow valley or through an enchanted forest then they might suffer ambushes and other encounters fixed to various points along their travel plan. Then the plot is getting to the villain by surviving the intervening obstacle encounters.
81#100,Series of Villains,This is a very dramatic plot. The heroes have undertaken a quest - usually the finding and defeat of the master villain. They may have to travel to his citadel or head off in another direction to find some artifact capable of defeating him or run away from pursuing villains until they can figure out what is going on. All along their route they are set upon by villains - each villain has a name and distinct personality and each encounter is life-or-death for the heroes and villains; the villain never escapes to safety if the tide turns against him - he fights unto death. The adventure becomes a war of attrition; the villains gradually wear down the heroes - perhaps killing some of them - as the heroes go about their quest. By the time the heroes reach their enemy there is no doubt that one side or the other will utterly perish.
